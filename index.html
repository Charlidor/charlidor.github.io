Charles Nicolle was a French bacteriologist originated from Rouen, who discovered the mean of transmission of typhus and received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for this discovery. <br>\ <br>\ I believe that medicine is like a bicycle: to keep a balance, it must keep moving. The engine of this bike is research that leads to movement by knowledge through the fuel of questioning. <br>\ <br>\ Currently, I am a research student at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, studying neural circuits that underlie behaviors and physiological states. <br>\ <br>\ In addition to medicine, I have other passions such as the piano, scuba diving, and computer sciences.";

We spoke the same language without sharing a common background. However, each person in the classroom brought her perspective to the assignments. We have learned together as including and helping every person. This experience abroad made me realize that diversity makes us better human beings. It marked me forever and fostered my drive to help others. Medicine was the perfect path for this purpose. <br>\ <br>\ To be admitted in the second year of medicine in France, there is a harsh selection that very few people can get through. Those who can afford to take private lessons have a real advantage over the others, left to themselves with little or no mentorship. In my case, in addition to live far away from the university, which was time-consuming, I did not have the guidance I needed at that time for preparing this selection. It was a real struggle for me. Therefore, following my entrance to the second year of medicine, I decided to help other students who shared similar struggles. I volunteered to be the mentor of first-year medical students.";
